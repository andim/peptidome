# How different are self and nonself? 

Can we understand self/nonself discrimination as a statistical classification problem?

This was the question we started pondering in the summer of 2018. After long years of analysis and discussion, we finally arrived at some conceptual clarity and to the conclusion that self/nonself discrimination operates in a different regime.

We are sharing our full set of analyses here following the open science ethos. Note though that this code relates to research in progress. This means:
- It contains analyses not currently part of our preprint, but that informed our thinking.
- It is likely to not be user-friendly.  

Feedback very welcome!

As in our previous work (see e.g. [Gaimann et al](https://github.com/andim/paper-tcellimprint)) we have stand-alone code located at [our paper's repo](https://github.com/jonlevi/self_not_self), allowing direct reproduction of figures from the manuscript.
