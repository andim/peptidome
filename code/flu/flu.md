# An analysis of HCV proteome diversity

HCV consists of a single open reading frame, which is then further processed to produce the active proteins. Sequence data was downloaded from https://hcv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/HCV/ToolsOutline.html

Doublet Jensen-Shannon Divergence (scaled to 9mers) based on HCV proteins shows emergence of different clusters. Within each cluster statistics are very similar while betweeen the clusters the differences are quite large. It is not currently clear what explains this pattern. Note that to avoid confounding by different HCV types the analysis was restricted to subtype 1a.
