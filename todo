- Malaria: which proteins do the IEDB epitopes come from? (Life stages etc)
- check distribution of distances to closest self antigen for IEDB epitopes
- work out probability of neighbors as a function of your probability in an independent model
- How does crossreactivity influence peripheral self/non-self discrimination based on the small differences in the underlying distributions we find?
- no peripheral tolerance for antigens in immune-priviledged sites (e.g. testis). Do they have different statistics?
- look at which malaria proteins are expressed in which life stage
