      {\textless}p{\textgreater}Generating and maintaining a diverse repertoire of naive T cells is essential for
         protection against pathogens, and developing a mechanistic and quantitative description
         of the processes involved lies at the heart of our understanding of vertebrate immunity.
         Here, we review the biology of naive T cells from birth to maturity and outline how
         the integration of mathematical models and experiments has helped us to develop a
         full picture of their life histories.
